**Project Information**

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a specialized deep learning model that excels at image classification by recognizing patterns directly from pixel data. For datasets like MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, CNNs are highly effective. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0â€“9) and includes 60,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing. Fashion-MNIST has the same structure but contains images of fashion items like shirts, shoes, and bags, organized into 10 categories. These datasets are widely used to test image classification models because they represent a variety of recognizable shapes and patterns.
